## Forecasting Time Series

This week we will learn a number of standard approaches for forecasting from time series alone (meaning without any covariates or exogenous variables).  In later, weeks we will address how to incorporate covariates into a time series model and forecast.

## Many approaches are available for non-seasonal modeling

## Forecasting Time Series

We will focus on a subset of these methods.  There are methods have a very long tradition (ARIMA), are often found to be the best or equally best method (Exponential smoothing), are non-parametric and recently used in a number of fisheries papers (EDM), and are commonly used in many variants (DLM):

- Time-varying regression
- Box-Jenkins models, aka ARIMA models
- Exponential Smoothing
- Empirical dynamic modeling (EDM)
- Dynamic linear modeling (DLM)

## Stergiou and Christou 1996

I will demonstrate these methods by replicating the work in Stergiou and Christou (1996) Modelling and forecasting annual fisheries catches: comparison of regression, univariate and multivariate time series methods. Fisheries Research 25: 105-136.

## Data

We will use the annual landings data from Hellenic (Greek) waters that were used in Stergiou and Christou (1996). Stergiou and Christou analyzed 16 species.  We will look a subset of species: Anchovy, Sardine, Chub mackerel, Horse mackerel, and Jack mackerel.  Stergiou and Christou used the data from 1964-1989.  We have the data up to 2007, but will focus mainly on 1964-1989 (the first half of the time series) to replicate Stergiou and Christou's analyses.

Load the data as follows and use only the 1964-1989 data.
```{r load_data, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
load("Data/landings.RData")
landings$log.metric.tons = log(landings$metric.tons)
landings = subset(landings, Year <= 1989)
landings = subset(landings, Species %in% c("Anchovy","Sardine"))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(landings, aes(x=Year, y=log.metric.tons)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap(~Species)
```

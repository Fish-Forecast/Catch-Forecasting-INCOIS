This week we will learn a number of standard approaches for forecasting from catch time series.  We will be using the data and methods discussed in Stergiou and Christou (1996) Modelling and forecasting annual fisheries catches: comparison of regression, univariate and multivariate time series methods. Fisheries Research 25: 105-136.

The lectures and labs can be found on the tabs in the top navigation bar.  An online book of the material is [here](https://fish-forecast.github.io/Fish-Forecast-Bookdown/).

We will be using classic methods for catch forecasting discussed in the following reference papers:

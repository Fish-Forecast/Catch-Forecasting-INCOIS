## Basic idea

Past values in the time series have information about the current state.  An ARMA model models as a linear relationship of current values with past values.:

`$$x_t = \phi_1 x_{t-1} + \phi_2 x_{t-2} + ... + \phi_p x_{t-p} + e_t$$`

## ARIMA models (Box-Jenkins models)

You will commonly see ARIMA models referred to as *Box-Jenkins* models.  This model has 3 components (p, d, q):

- **AR autoregressive**  `\(y_t\)` depends on past values. The AR level is maximum lag `\(p\)`.

`$$x_t = \phi_1 x_{t-1} + \phi_2 x_{t-2} + ... + \phi_p x_{t-p} + e_t$$`

- **I differencing** `\(x_t\)` may be a difference of the observed time series.  The number of differences is denoted `\(d\)`. First difference is `\(d=1\)`:

`$$x_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$$`

- **MA moving average**  The error `\(e_t\)` can be a sum of a time series of independent random errors.  The maximum lag is denoted `\(q\)`.

`$$e_t = \eta_t + \theta_1 \eta_{t-1} + \theta_2 \eta_{t-2} + ... + \theta_q \eta_{t-q},\quad \eta_t \sim N(0, \sigma)$$`

---

## Box-Jenkins Method

This refers to a step-by-step process of selecting a forecasting model.  You need to go through the steps otherwise you could end up fitting a nonsensical model or using fitting a sensible model with an algorithm that will not work on your data.

A. Model form selection
    1. Evaluate stationarity and seasonality
    2. Selection of the differencing level (d)
    3. Selection of the AR level (p)
    4. Selection of the MA level (q)
    
B. Parameter estimation

C. Model checking

## Stationarity

Stationarity means 'not changing in time' in the context of time-series models.  Typically we test the trend and variance, however more generally all statistical properties of a time-series is time-constant if the time series is 'stationary'.

Many ARMA models exhibit stationarity.  White noise is one type:
`$$x_t = e_t, e_t \sim N(0,\sigma)$$`

---

An AR-1 process with `\(b&lt;1\)`
`$$x_t = b x_{t-1} + e_t$$`
is also stationary.

&lt;img src="Forecasting_3_-_ARMA_files/figure-html/fig.stationarity2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

The processes shown have mean 0 and a flat level.  We can also have stationarity around an non-zero level or stationarity around an linear trend. If `\(b=0\)`, we have white noise and if `\(b&lt;1\)` we have AR-1.

1. Non-zero mean: `\(x_t = \mu + b x_{t-1} + e_t\)`

2. Linear trend: `\(x_t = \mu + at + b x_{t-1} + e_t\)`

&lt;img src="Forecasting_3_-_ARMA_files/figure-html/fig.stationarity3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Non-stationarity

One of the most common forms of non-stationarity that is tested for is 'unit root', which means that the process is a random walk:
`$$x_t = x_{t-1} + e_t$$` .

&lt;img src="Forecasting_3_-_ARMA_files/figure-html/fig.nonstationarity-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

Similar to the way we added an intecept and linear trend to the stationarity processes, we can do the same to the random walk.

1. Non-zero mean or intercept: `\(x_t = \mu + x_{t-1} + e_t\)`

2. Linear trend: `\(x_t = \mu + at + x_{t-1} + e_t\)`

The effects are fundamentally different however.  The addition of `\(\mu\)` leads to a upward mean linear trend while the addition of `\(at\)` leads to exponential growth.

&lt;img src="Forecasting_3_-_ARMA_files/figure-html/fig.stationarity4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Detecting stationarity

Why is evaluating stationarity important? Many AR models have a flat level or trend and time-constant variance.  If your data do not have those properties, you are fitting a model that is fundamentally inconsistent with your data.  In addition, many standard algorithms for fitting ARIMA models assume stationarity.  Note, you can fit ARIMA models without making this assumption, but you need to use the appropriate algorithm.

We will discuss three common approaches to evaluating stationarity:

- Visual test
- (Augmented) Dickey-Fuller test
- KPSS test

---

## Visual test

The visual test is simply looking at a plot of the data versus time.  Look for

- Change in the level over time.  Is the time series increasing or decreasing?  Does it appear to cycle?
- Change in the variance over time.  Do deviations away from the mean change over time, increase or decrease?

Note, if you are using an augmented Dickey-Fuller test, you may inadvertantly invalidate your test by looking at the data.

---

Here is a plot of the anchovy and sardine in Greek waters from 1965 to 1989.  The anchovies have an obvious non-stationary trend during this period.  The mean level is going up.  The sardines have a roughly stationary trend.  The variance (deviations away from the mean) appear to be roughly stationary, neither increasing or decreasing in time.

&lt;img src="Forecasting_3_-_ARMA_files/figure-html/fig.vis-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Although the logged anchovy time series is increasing, it appears to have an linear trend.

---

## Dickey-Fuller test

The Dickey=Fuller test (and Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) look for evidence that the time series has a unit root.  The null hypothesis is that the time series has a unit root, that is, it has a random walk component.  The alternative hypothesis is some variation of stationarity.  The test has three main verisons. 

---

Visually, the null and alternative hypotheses for the three Dickey-Fuller tests are the following.  It is hard to see but in the panels on the left, the variance around the trend is increasing and on the right, it is not.

&lt;img src="Forecasting_3_-_ARMA_files/figure-html/fig.df-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

In math, here are the null and alternative hypotheses.  In each, we are testing if `\(\delta=0\)`.

1. Null is a random walk with no drift
`\(x_t = x_{t-1}+e_t\)`

Alternative is a mean-reverting (stationary) process with zero mean.
`\(x_t = \delta x_{t-1}+e_t\)`

2. Null is a random walk with drift (linear STOCHASTIC trend)
`\(x_t = \mu + x_{t-1} + e_t\)`

Alternative is a mean-reverting (stationary) process with non-zero mean and no trend.
`\(x_t = \mu + \delta x_{t-1} + e_t\)`

2. Null is a random walk with exponential trend
`\(x_t = \mu + at + x_{t-1} + e_t\)`

Alternative is a mean-reverting (stationary) process with non-zero mean and linear DETERMINISTIC trend.
`\(x_t = \mu + at + \delta x_{t-1} + e_t\)`

---



## Example: Dickey-Fuller tests on the Anchovy and Sardine time series

The `urca` R package can be used to apply the Dickey-Fuller tests.  Use `lags=0` for Dickey-Fuller which tests for AR-1 stationarity.

```
ur.df(y, type = c("none", "drift", "trend"), lags = 0)
```


```r
require(urca)
test = ur.df(anchovy, type="none", lags=0)
test
```

```
## 
## ############################################################### 
## # Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test Unit Root / Cointegration Test # 
## ############################################################### 
## 
## The value of the test statistic is: 0.8195
```

`ur.df()` will report the test statistic.  You an look up the values of the test statistic for different `\(\alpha\)` levels using `summary(test)` or `attr(test, "cval")`.  If the test statistic is less than the critical value for `\(\alpha\)`=0.05 ('5pct' in cval), it means the null hypothesis of non-stationarity is rejected.  For the Dickey-Fuller test, you do want to reject the null hypothesis.

The test statistic is 0.8195156 and the critical value at `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` is -1.95.  The statistic is larger than the critical value and thus the null hypothesis of non-stationarity is not rejected.

---

## Augmented Dickey-Fuller test

The Dickey-Fuller test assumes that the stationary process is AR-1 (autoregressive lag-1).  The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test allows a general stationary process.  The idea of the test however is the same.

We can apply the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test with the `ur.df()` function or the `adf.test()` function in the `tseries` package.

```
adf.test(x, alternative = c("stationary", "explosive"),
         k = trunc((length(x)-1)^(1/3)))
```

The alternative is either stationary like `\(y_t = b y_{t-1} + \eta_t\)` with `\(b&lt;1\)` or 'explosive' with `\(b&gt;1\)`.  `k` is the number of lags which determines the number of time lags allowed in the autoregression.  `k` is generally determined by the length of your time series.

## Example: Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests


```r
require(tseries)
adf.test(anchovy)
```

```
## 
## 	Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
## 
## data:  anchovy
## Dickey-Fuller = -1.6851, Lag order = 2, p-value = 0.6923
## alternative hypothesis: stationary
```

```r
adf.test(sardine)
```

```
## 
## 	Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
## 
## data:  sardine
## Dickey-Fuller = -1.3581, Lag order = 2, p-value = 0.8169
## alternative hypothesis: stationary
```

In both cases, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the data have a random walk.  Thus there is not support for these time-series being stationary.

---

## KPSS test

In the Dickey-Fuller test, the null hypothesis is the unit root, i.e. random walk.  Often times, there is not enough power to reject the null hypothesis.  A null hypothesis is accepted unless there is strong evidence against it.  The Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test has as the null hypothesis that a time series is stationary around a level trend (or a linear trend). The alternative hypothesis for the KPSS test is a random walk.

The stationarity assumption is general; it does not assume a specific type of stationarity such as white noise.

If both KPSS and Dickey-Fuller tests support non-stationarity, then the stationarity assumption is not supported.

---

## Example: KPSS tests


```r
require(tseries)
kpss.test(anchovy, null="Trend")
```

```
## 
## 	KPSS Test for Trend Stationarity
## 
## data:  anchovy
## KPSS Trend = 0.1646, Truncation lag parameter = 1, p-value =
## 0.0345
```

```r
kpss.test(sardine, null="Trend")
```

```
## 
## 	KPSS Test for Trend Stationarity
## 
## data:  sardine
## KPSS Trend = 0.18142, Truncation lag parameter = 1, p-value =
## 0.02297
```

Here `null="Trend"` was included to account for the increasing trend in the data.  The null hypothesis of stationarity is rejected in both cases.  Thus both the KPSS and Dickey-Fuller tests support the hypothesis that the anchovy and sardine time series are non-stationary.

---

## Differencing the data to make the mean stationary

Differencing means to create a new time series  `\(z_t = x_t - x_{t-1}\)`.  First order differencing means you do this once (so `\(z_t\)`) and second order differencing means you do this twice (so `\(z_t - z_{t-1}\)`).

The `diff()` function takes the first difference:


```r
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(anchovy, type="l")
plot(diff(anchovy), type="l")
```

![](Forecasting_3_-_ARMA_files/figure-html/diff1-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---

Let's test the anchovy and sardine data with one difference.


```r
diff.anchovy = diff(anchovy)
diff.sardine = diff(sardine)
kpss.test(diff.anchovy)
```

```
## Warning in kpss.test(diff.anchovy): p-value greater than printed p-value
```

```
## 
## 	KPSS Test for Level Stationarity
## 
## data:  diff.anchovy
## KPSS Level = 0.061629, Truncation lag parameter = 1, p-value = 0.1
```

```r
kpss.test(diff.sardine)
```

```
## Warning in kpss.test(diff.sardine): p-value greater than printed p-value
```

```
## 
## 	KPSS Test for Level Stationarity
## 
## data:  diff.sardine
## KPSS Level = 0.083041, Truncation lag parameter = 1, p-value = 0.1
```

The null hypothesis of stationairity is not rejected.
